# Multi-Layer-Perceptron
 
Implemented a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network from scratch in Python using the error backpropagation algorithm to classify a provided dataset. Evaluated the performance of the network using various metrics and compared it with a simple linear regression model. Tried different improvements to the backpropagation algorithm, including momentum, and reported on these. Documented the implementation process, training, and evaluation in a report.
